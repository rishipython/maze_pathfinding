# Maze Pathfinding Visualization

## Project Summary
A web-based maze generation and pathfinding visualization tool that demonstrates different search algorithms.

## Tasks
- [x] Project setup and structure
- [x] Basic Flask application setup
- [x] HTML canvas and UI controls
- [ ] Implement maze generation algorithm
- [ ] Implement BFS pathfinding
- [ ] Implement DFS pathfinding
- [ ] Add visualization animations

## Setup Instructions
1. Navigate to project directory: `cd /Users/rishi/Desktop/Work/maze_pathfinding`
2. Activate virtual environment:
   - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - Unix/Mac: `source venv/bin/activate`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install flask`
4. Run application: `python app.py`
5. Open browser to: `http://localhost:5000`

## Dependencies
